# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Risk and Predictive Analytics Project 📊

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to the AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) project! This exciting initiative focuses on leveraging predictive analytics and risk modeling to transform the way car insurance is approached within South Africa. As a Marketing Analytics Engineer, your role will be to dive deep into historical insurance claim data to fine-tune marketing strategies, identify low-risk targets for premium adjustments, and optimize client acquisition efforts.

## 🏆 Business Objective

The goal of this project is to optimize marketing efforts and premium pricing for ACIS by utilizing historical insurance claim data. The end result is a more data-driven approach to attracting low-risk clients, ensuring better premium pricing, and driving marketing success.

## 💡 Motivation

This project isn't just about solving a business problem—it's a great opportunity for you to level up your skills in:

- Data Engineering (DE)
- Predictive Analytics (PA)
- Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)

Through hands-on experience with hypothesis testing and predictive modeling, you'll gain a deep understanding of financial analytics in the insurance industry.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Problem Statement

ACIS needs to enhance its marketing effectiveness and client acquisition strategies. This project will help uncover insights into:

- Risk factors across different demographics
- Geographic segmentation (e.g., provinces, zip codes)
- Premium adjustments for low-risk clients

The ultimate goal is to offer smarter, data-driven insurance products that attract the right customers and optimize pricing.

## 🎯 Objectives

Here's what you'll achieve in this project:

### 🔰 1. Understand Insurance Terminologies
Gain a clear understanding of industry-specific terms, which will be crucial for analyzing and interpreting data.

### 🔰 2. Conduct A/B Hypothesis Testing
Use A/B testing to compare risk across different demographics and locations. You'll test hypotheses to determine the impact of various risk factors.

### 🔰 3. Develop Predictive Models
Create predictive models to forecast total claims and suggest optimal premium values based on data features like demographics and claim histories.

### 🔰 4. Report Findings
Document your process, findings, and provide actionable insights that will help ACIS refine their marketing and pricing strategies.

## 📊 Data

The project is based on historical insurance claim data from February 2014 to August 2015. The dataset includes:

- Client demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
- Claims data (e.g., types of claims, amounts)
- Geographic data (e.g., provinces, zip codes)
- Payment histories and premium details

## 🚨 Tasks

### 🔧 Task 1: Git and GitHub Setup
- Create a GitHub repository with a detailed README
- Set up version control using Git and CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset

### 🔧 Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)
- Install DVC to version control the dataset
- Use DVC to track and manage changes in the data

### 🔧 Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing
- Conduct A/B tests across various demographics (gender, province, zip code) to evaluate risk factors and premium adjustments
- Perform statistical analysis to test the significance of these differences

### 🔧 Task 4: Statistical Modeling
- Prepare the data (handle missing data, encode categorical variables)
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost)
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision
- Use SHAP or LIME for model interpretability

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have gained:

- Data management skills (handling large, complex datasets)
- Expertise in hypothesis testing and predictive modeling
- Hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and their evaluation
- Advanced skills in Python for data analysis and modeling

## 🔝 Contribution
