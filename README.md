# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Risk and Predictive Analytics Project

## Executive Summary

AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) is focused on advancing risk and predictive analytics for car insurance within South Africa. As a Marketing Analytics Engineer, your role involves analyzing historical insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies, identify "low-risk" targets for premium adjustments, and attract new clients.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance risk and predictive analytics for car insurance at ACIS. By analyzing historical insurance claim data, we aim to refine marketing strategies and identify low-risk clients who may benefit from reduced premiums.

## Motivation

This project is designed to develop and refine skills in Data Engineering (DE), Predictive Analytics (PA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). It provides a realistic simulation of financial analytics challenges, emphasizing the application of hypothesis testing and predictive modeling in the insurance industry.

## Problem Statement

ACIS seeks to improve its marketing effectiveness and client acquisition strategies through detailed analysis of historical insurance claim data. The goal is to adjust premiums for low-risk clients and gain insights into risk factors across various demographics and geographic locations.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Insurance Terminologies**:
   - Build a foundational understanding of insurance terms.

2. **Conduct A/B Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Test hypotheses to assess risk differences and margin impacts across demographics and geographic locations.

3. **Develop Predictive Models**:
   - Fit linear regression models and create machine learning models to predict total claims and optimal premium values based on various features.

4. **Report Findings**:
   - Document methodologies, findings, and recommendations to help ACIS tailor insurance products more effectively.

## Data

The dataset covers historical insurance claim data from February 2014 to August 2015.
